# Integrations Module

## Overview

The Integrations module provides connectivity between OATFLAKE and external platforms, services, and communication channels. This module enables OATFLAKE to interact with users through various platforms, receive commands, send notifications, and integrate with third-party services.

## Current Integrations

### Slack Integration (`slack.py`)

The Slack integration enables OATFLAKE to communicate with users through Slack channels, respond to messages, and provide knowledge base access directly within Slack workspaces.

#### Features

- **Command Processing**: Respond to specific commands in Slack channels
- **Knowledge Base Access**: Search and retrieve information from the OATFLAKE knowledge base
- **Interactive Messages**: Send rich, interactive messages with buttons and other UI elements
- **Event Handling**: Process various Slack events like messages, reactions, etc.
- **Authentication**: Secure authentication flow with Slack API

#### Configuration

Slack integration requires the following environment variables:

```
SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=your-slack-bot-token
SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET=your-slack-signing-secret
SLACK_BOT_USER_ID=your-slack-bot-user-id
```

#### Usage Example

```python
from scripts.integrations.slack import slack_app, send_message

# Send a message to a specific channel
await send_message("#general", "Hello from OATFLAKE!")

# Handle a slash command
@slack_app.command("/oatflake")
async def handle_command(ack, command, say):
    await ack()
    query = command["text"]
    result = process_query(query)
    await say(f"Result: {result}")
```

## Planned Integrations

### Telegram Integration (Coming Soon)

Future integration with Telegram will allow users to interact with OATFLAKE through Telegram bots, providing similar functionality to the Slack integration but for Telegram users.

Planned features include:
- Bot commands for searching the knowledge base
- Document and URL processing through Telegram
- User authentication and access control
- Rich message formatting with Telegram's markdown support

### Maps Integration (Coming Soon)

Future integration with mapping services will allow OATFLAKE to process and display geographic information, potentially including:
- Location-based queries and search
- Visualization of geographic data
- Resource mapping based on location data
- Integration with popular mapping APIs

## Architecture

Each integration follows a common pattern:

1. **Authentication**: Secure connection to the external service
2. **Event Handling**: Processing incoming events from the service
3. **Command Parsing**: Interpreting user commands
4. **Response Formatting**: Preparing appropriate responses
5. **Message Delivery**: Sending formatted responses back to the service

## Development Guidelines

When developing new integrations:

1. **Environment Management**: Use environment variables for all sensitive credentials
2. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling for API failures
3. **Rate Limiting**: Respect API rate limits of the integration service
4. **Stateless Design**: Avoid storing state when possible
5. **Fallback Mechanisms**: Provide graceful degradation when services are unavailable

### Integration Template

New integrations should follow this template:

```python
# filepath: scripts/integrations/new_service.py
import os
import logging
from dotenv import load_dotenv

# Setup
load_dotenv()
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

# Configuration
SERVICE_API_KEY = os.environ.get("SERVICE_API_KEY")

class ServiceIntegration:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize the integration
        pass
        
    async def send_message(self, target, content):
        # Send a message to the service
        pass
        
    async def process_incoming_event(self, event):
        # Process an incoming event from the service
        pass

# Initialize if credentials are available
if SERVICE_API_KEY:
    service = ServiceIntegration()
    logger.info("Service integration initialized successfully.")
else:
    service = None
    logger.warning("Service integration not initialized. Missing API key.")
```

## Testing

Each integration includes unit tests that can be run with:

```bash
python -m pytest tests/integrations/test_slack.py
```

Mock services are used to simulate API responses during testing.
